# REST_API_Demo

Developed using Unreal Engine 4

Stage runner is a self developed Unreal Engine 4/Spring Boot/Jupyter Notebook project. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to visualize continuous player data utilizing Jupyter Notebook. This Project makes use of the Spring Boot Framework, which was used to develop the back-end web service and REST APIs. Stage runner, an Unreal Engine 4 based game, utilizes these REST APIs by sending and receiving specific player data from the back-end server.
